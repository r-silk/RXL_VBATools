# RXL_VBATools
A repository for storing, and sharing Excel-based VBA tools

In this repository, useful VBA tools and pieces of code are stored within Excel files (.xlsm, .xlsb) along with copies of the raw VBA code modules (.bas, .frm, .frx). These Excel files include some documentation and examples of the code in use to help the user understand how the code is intended to be used and how the code works.

If you wish to use the VBA code within your own Excel projects, there are two main options available to you:\
1. Copy from a demo Excel file
   * Download the appropriate demo Excel file and open the file
   * Open the Excel VB Editor and find the required VBA module or UserForm in the Project Explorer window
   * Right-click on the required module(s)/UserForm(s), select "Export File..." and save the VBA code file(s) to an appropriate location, such as your local Downloads folder or Desktop
   * Find your Excel project in the VB Editor Explorer Window, right-click on the project name, and select "Import File..."
   * Goto to the folder where you saved the VBA code file(s), select the required file(s), and click "Open"\

2. Import the VBA code files directly
   * Download the required VBA code file(s) from the repository and save the VBA code file(s) to an appropriate location, such as your local Downloads folder or Desktop
   * With your Excel project open, open the Excel VB Editor
   * Right-click on the name of your Excel project in the VB Editor Explorer Window and select "Import File..."
   * Goto to the folder where you saved the VBA code file(s), select the required file(s), and click "Open"
